# Postcode Battle

**http://postcode-battle.serwylo.com**

We see open government data as a chance for the government to inform its citizens, and for the citizens to inform the government; as a chance to foster communication and cooperation. In our project, we ask: where is infrastructure sufficient, and where are services lacking? If I want to move to a different suburb, where are my needs and interests best catered for?

We gather data of victorian suburbs and LGAs for a number of relevant life quality indicators. These indicators - collected from a wealth of open government datasets - include housing prices, number of schools and medical service providers, and crime and accident statistics. We summarize the data into a general "liveability index" for each LGA, and allow users to specify -and weigh- indicators of interest. By displaying the results as a colour coded map, we allow an intuitive understanding the results.

Our project identifies both benefits and deficiencies of living in certain areas, and offers suggestions where strategic investment can increase the quality of life.

# GovHack

This project was created over a single weekend of GovHack 2015 in Melbourne. 

The web page at http://postcode-battle.serwylo.com is as it was at the end of GovHack. It will stay this way for judging purposes.
